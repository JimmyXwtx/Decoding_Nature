## Documentation of Project The Charm of Circulating Decimals
### Project Intro:
We are all familiar with cyclic decimals in our daily life. Have you ever imagined that the cycle period of each recurring decimal may be a key factor in drawing a beautiful graph? In this project, each graph is made up of line segments of the same length. Each line is drawn on top of the previous one. And the angle is rotated according to the number of digits of the cyclic decimal, and finally, the wonderful image is drawn.
